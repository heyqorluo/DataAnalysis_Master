CPI ? RPI? Core inflation?  All of which are measured differently and themselves manipulated and very selective.,3,10,1,1,14,4,3,2,1,1,1,1,10,"The question is invalid. If you are talking about ACTUAL bonds then what matters is the yield not the nominal interest rate. So getting the 'full investment back' presupposes that you are buying at par. The price will in fact fluctuate with interest rates as the yield (return on price PAID rather than nominal will have to match interest rates)  Then you have the problem of HOW the inflation 'protected' bond is actually calculated. Which measure? How often is it updated? So-called bonds (not traded instruments but savings) from National Savings were very popular in the 80s and gave a good protection. Inevitably they ceased to be issued and modern ones do not offer the same level. You need to read the terms VERY carefully!!!!  CLAIMING inflation protection is NOT the same thing as definitely providing it. The costs will often result in a lower return that does not reflect true general price inflation. If the measure is CPI then you are probably better off avoiding it. Without full details you should not commit to a decision!!  Re question below which is even more invalid. Unless you know HOW the inflation measure is being calculated, you have no way of judging whether it is a good deal against ACTUAL price inflation. Please do remember that the classical definition of inflation is actually the expansion of the money supply. The price inflation is a consequence and never felt evenly. For example, for several decades we have been pushing the inflation into asset prices rather than consumer goods. Price inflation in basic needs such as food, energy, water, transport and for some local taxes are currently far higher than the official inflation rates. So if your PERSONAL inflation rate which is a product of the mix of things you buy is concentrated around these (lower incomes) then you are most likely better off looking for a better deal and not buying either. The boast of 'inflation protection' on a bond is likely to be hollow for most people. Lastly, it is NOT a true investment if your aim is simply to earn interest from lending money. ",,5,3,1,1,10,"Again, the inflation protected (so-called) only mitigates the effects of inflation not negates it. The text itself says that the inflation protected only provides 'stable but lower real return regardless of inflation'.  The answer is that you do not buy either. If you have this much capital to deploy then you must look at WHAT it is needed for and WHEN it is needed and search for more suitable ACTUAL investments that may deliver a real return (something above inflation) for that timescale. The choices you offer are only between different rates of purchasing power erosion.
